# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
COVID-19 and Baby Boom in Germany

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Is the rumour of "COVID Baby Boom" true?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
COVID-19 changed our life-styles dramatically. Due to lockdowns, new working styles were implemented and people who used to work in the office spend more time with their life partners at home. On one hand, someone argues that this contributes to higher divorce rate, but on the other hand there are also rumours about baby boom due to the COVID-19.

Since there is no comprehensive study/survey collecting actual number of home-office in Germany before and after COVID, this project would aim to compare number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and the number of newborn babies in Germany to figure out if there is any interesting insight.

## Datasources
